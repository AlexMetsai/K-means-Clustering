# K-means-Clustering
K-means clustering using python and scikit-learn.

All dependencies are provided in the enviroment.yml file.
Main dependencies include:
python 3.6
scikit-learn 0.23
pandas 1.0.5
scipy 1.5

Train the model using the command:
```
python fit_kmeans.py
```

The model achieves 72% accuracy on the training set and 71% on the testing set.

A REST API was developed for deploying the model as a service. See the README inside the corresponding folder for more information regarding this functionality.
